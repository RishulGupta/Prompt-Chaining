# Prompt Chaining 🔗🧠

**Prompt Chaining** is a technique in natural language processing where multiple prompts are sequenced together to guide a language model through a complex task or reasoning process. Rather than relying on a single prompt, this method breaks tasks into smaller, manageable steps — with each step building on the previous one — leading to more accurate, coherent, and controlled outputs.

## 🧭 What’s Inside?

This project demonstrates how to implement prompt chaining using [**LangGraph**](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph), a flexible framework designed to support structured and multi-step interactions with language models.

LangGraph lets you:
- Define **nodes** (representing individual prompts or tasks).
- Connect them with **edges** (defining the flow of information).
- Execute workflows where the output of one prompt becomes the input of the next.

This graph-based setup is ideal for:
- Multi-step reasoning
- Tool-augmented conversations
- Intelligent assistants and agents
- Research in prompt engineering
